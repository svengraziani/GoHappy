<img style="float: right;" src="images/wth.png">
The solution for the „What the hack!“ hackathon (http://www.hackathon.click/) developed by the Austrian team. The event took part from 24.06.2016 till 26.06.2016 in St.Salvator 9361 (Austria).
The main idea of the hackathon was to develop a mobility app for the region of Carinthia.

## The challenge

You travel to a destination using different means of transport (train, bus, taxi, car sharing, bike) and there is no need to buy any ticket because your mobile device will gather all the information about your trip, chooses the best option for you and registers each check-in and check-out in the different used vehicles along your journey accordingly to the distance.

## Our vision of the solution

Within a timeframe of 48 hours we implemented our vision of the future public transportation.

Imagine you wake up in the moring and prepare yourself for going out and there are many options of public transports to take... But do not worry -- the only thing you have to do is to PUSH ONE BUTTON on your phone or smart watch. Your friend can easily travel with you by another click. You can move without worrying about different tariffs or tickets on public transport to your destination. When you reach the destination, click the stop button. At the power of a fingertip you are enabled to use a taxi, a boat across the Wörthersee or enjoy the benefits of bike or car sharing. Plan your next trip by activating your travel assistant which gives you even more freedom to care about waht really matters to you. Going to work, holidays or sports lessons: DON'T WORRY -- GO HAPPY!
